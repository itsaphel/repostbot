# Repost Bot

A bot that watches for reposts on reddit.

To configure, add the necessary information into [config.json](https://github.com/itsaphel/repostbot/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.json) and place it in the same directory as the .jar file.

You will need to create a MySQL database for this to work. You will also need a reddit account with API access.
